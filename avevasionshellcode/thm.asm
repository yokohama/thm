GOBACK:
    mov rax, 0x1
    mov rdi, 0x1
    pop rsi         ; 3) we are popping into `rsi`; now we have the
                    ; address of "THM, Rocks\r\n"
    mov rdx, 0xd
    syscall

    mov rax, 0x3c
    mov rdi, 0x0
    syscall

MESSAGE:
    call GOBACK     ; 2) we are going back, since we used `call`, that means
                    ; the return address, which is, in this case, the address
                    ; of "THM, Rocks!\r\n", is pushed into the stack.
    db "THM, Rocks!", 0dh, 0ah
